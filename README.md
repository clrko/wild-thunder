# Thunder
ðŸ‘‰[The app is live here](https://wild-thunder.netlify.app/) ðŸ‘ˆ 

**Thunder** is a responsive musical quiz web application which gives the opportunity to enrich our musical knowledge. 
The user will test his current knowledge by guessing the artist name of the song being played. The user also has the opportunity to save his favorite tracks and top ranks thanks to the authentification system. Finally, at the end of each game session, our recommendation system will provide the list of the similar artists of the ones that were played during the game.

## The project

The projet has been developed as part of the web developement training program at [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/en-GB), for 5 weeks (April / May 2020). 

The aim was to create a React.js application and manipulate data from an API. We also learnt and applied the agile methods (in particular SCRUM). In doing so, we strated by designing a Wireframe, we elaborated a product Backlog by defining the different user stories and the implicated Tech Tasks. Finally, along the project we used Trello to better organise and track our progress. 

This 5-week project has been an even bigger challenge for our team as we were working remotly, given the global health crisis we were experiencing due to the Coronavirus. Thanks to our rigour and determination, we have succeeded in developing this fully functional application.
